03_flow_router.py - route flow over a DEM, map the streams (D8 by
default; MFD, Dinf and MDinf on request).

Created on Sat Jul 4 2026
@author: Antti Ahokas
Written with Claude Code (Anthropic).

Pipeline stage 3 (see README.md):
    reads   data/02_breached/*.tif      (02_fill_dem.py output; this branch
                                         defaults to its breach mode)
    writes  data/03_flows/              (networks, summary CSV and the
                                         flow_direction_*.tif rasters that
                                         04_flow_accumulation.py reads)

Takes one or more hydrologically conditioned DEM tiles (GeoTIFFs in
data/02_breached), mosaics them into a single surface so streams can cross
tile edges, and runs the selected flow-routing algorithms on it. The
default is D8 alone - the format the rest of the pipeline consumes;
select more with --fdir (e.g. --fdir all). Per selected algorithm it
writes to data/03_flows:

  flow_network_<alg>.geojson   the stream network
  flow_networks_summary.csv    one row per algorithm: stream pixels and
                               area, pixels unique to that algorithm,
                               segment count and length, drainage
                               density, largest catchment, Jaccard
                               overlap with every other network, runtime

    With more than one algorithm selected the CSV is where they are
    compared: the dispersive methods' unique pixels are their braided,
    anastomosing footprint, and the Jaccard overlaps say how much any
    two networks agree. The GeoJSON lines are a D8-path approximation
    (see METHOD).

It also writes each selected algorithm's flow-DIRECTION raster - the
hand-off the downstream pipeline stages read - as GeoTIFFs whose band
descriptions and tags document their encoding:

  flow_direction_d8.tif        one int32 band of direction codes
                               (64=N 128=NE 1=E 2=SE 4=S 8=SW 16=W 32=NW)
  flow_direction_mfd.tif       eight float32 bands: the fraction of each
                               pixel's flow sent to its N, NE, E, SE, S,
                               SW, W, NW neighbour
  flow_direction_dinf.tif      one float32 band: flow angle in [0, 2*pi)
                               radians counter-clockwise from east
  flow_direction_mdinf.tif     eight float32 bands of flow fractions, like
                               MFD - computed by the companion module
                               mdinf.py

    (in d8 and dinf, -1 marks a flat and -2 a pit)

    flow_direction_mdinf.tif is special: pysheds does not implement
    MDinf, so the directions come from the companion module mdinf.py
    (the method's mathematics ported from Jan Seibert & Marc Vis's own
    implementation via WhiteboxTools' MIT-licensed source) and the
    accumulation from the shared kernel in accumulation.py.

The tuning knobs are constants at the top of the script:

    UPA_MIN                 minimum catchment (contributing) area that
                            starts a stream - shared with stages 5-6,
                            edit it in pipeline_io.py or override a
                            single run with --upa-min
    DEFAULT_METHODS         which algorithms run when --fdir is not
                            given (just "d8" out of the box)

USAGE
    python 03_flow_router.py                  # D8 only (the default)
    python 03_flow_router.py --upa-min 0.5    # override the stream threshold
    python 03_flow_router.py --fdir all       # run all four algorithms
    python 03_flow_router.py --fdir d8 dinf   # ... or a chosen subset
    python 03_flow_router.py --describe       # print the algorithm definitions
    python 03_flow_router.py --dem a.tif b.tif --outputs-dir results

COMPANION MODULES
    The unnumbered modules next to this script are part of it: mdinf.py
    (MDinf flow directions), accumulation.py (the accumulation kernel
    shared with stage 4) and pipeline_io.py (tile validation, provenance
    tags, lock-tolerant output swapping). The script is not meant to be
    copied around as a single file.

    GeoJSON output is RFC 7946 compliant (coordinates in WGS84), so the
    files drop straight into QGIS, geojson.io, kepler.gl, Leaflet, ...

METHOD
    All input tiles are checked to share one grid lattice and merged into
    one mosaic, which is routed as a single surface - a stream flowing
    off one tile continues onto the next instead of stopping at the seam.
    For every algorithm the contributing area is accumulated with that
    algorithm's own flow partitioning; pixels whose contributing area
    reaches the threshold are that algorithm's stream pixels. Those masks
    are taken exactly as the accumulation gives them, with no cleaning or
    pruning, and tabulated against each other in the summary CSV - when
    several algorithms are selected, the differences between them are
    the whole point: D8 gives a sparse
    single-threaded tree, while the dispersive methods (MFD, Dinf, MDinf)
    part around subtle highs and rejoin, so their masks carry extra,
    unique pixels (braided, anastomosing bands) that the unique-pixel
    counts and Jaccard overlaps expose. For the GeoJSON each mask is
    vectorized by connecting its pixels along D8 steepest-descent paths;
    a D8 tree can only converge, so the vector lines cannot braid and
    off-tree mask pixels drop out - treat the GeoJSON as a line
    approximation and the CSV as the measurement.

    The DEM is assumed hydrologically conditioned by stage 2: pits and
    depressions removed (filled or breached) AND flat ties resolved
    (02_fill_dem.py bakes tiny fix_flats gradients into float64
    outputs - float32 would collapse them back into ties).
    Routing is not conditioning, so none happens here; the script only
    verifies that the mosaic actually drains and stops with a pointer at
    the filling step if it does not. D8, MFD and Dinf run in pysheds;
    MDinf runs in the companion modules mdinf.py + accumulation.py
    (pysheds does not implement it).

THE FOUR ALGORITHMS (precise definitions, and credit where due)

  D8 - "deterministic eight-neighbour", O'Callaghan and Mark (1984)
    Each pixel discharges ALL of its flow to exactly one of its eight
    neighbours (4 cardinal, 4 diagonal): the one with the steepest
    downward drop rate (z_pixel - z_neighbour) / d, where d is the pixel
    size towards cardinal neighbours and pixel size * sqrt(2) towards
    diagonal ones. The result is a spanning tree of one-pixel-wide flow
    paths; contributing area grows in whole-pixel steps. Convergent,
    simple and fast, but it cannot represent divergent flow and imprints
    45-degree artefacts on hillslopes.
      Founder: O'Callaghan, J.F. and Mark, D.M. (1984) 'The extraction of
      drainage networks from digital elevation data', Computer Vision,
      Graphics, and Image Processing, 28(3), pp. 323-344.

  MFD - "multiple flow direction", Quinn et al. (1991)
    Flow from a pixel is divided among ALL lower neighbours at once.
    Each downslope neighbour i receives the fraction

        f_i = tan(beta_i)^p / sum_j tan(beta_j)^p

    of the pixel's flow, where beta_i is the downward slope towards
    neighbour i and j runs over every downslope neighbour (pysheds uses
    the original slope-proportional weighting; Freeman (1991) proposed
    p = 1.1). Dispersing flow over all descending directions represents
    divergent hillslope flow realistically at the cost of smearing flow
    paths, so accumulation is fractional rather than whole-pixel.
      Founder: Quinn, P., Beven, K., Chevallier, P. and Planchon, O. (1991)
      'The prediction of hillslope flow paths for distributed hydrological
      modelling using digital terrain models', Hydrological Processes,
      5(1), pp. 59-79. (Exponent variant: Freeman, T.G. (1991) 'Calculating
      catchment area with divergent flow based on a regular grid',
      Computers & Geosciences, 17(3), pp. 413-422.)

  Dinf - "D-infinity", Tarboton (1997)
    The flow direction is a CONTINUOUS angle in [0, 2*pi), taken as the
    steepest downward slope over the eight planar triangular facets
    formed between the pixel centre and each pair of adjacent neighbours.
    Flow is then apportioned to the two grid neighbours bracketing that
    angle, proportionally to how close the angle lies to each; an angle
    aligned exactly with a neighbour sends everything to that single
    pixel. This avoids D8's directional artefacts while keeping
    dispersion bounded (at most two receivers per pixel).
      Founder: Tarboton, D.G. (1997) 'A new method for the determination
      of flow directions and upslope areas in grid digital elevation
      models', Water Resources Research, 33(2), pp. 309-319.

  MDinf - "multiple direction D-infinity", Seibert and McGlynn (2007)
    A marriage of Dinf and MFD. Like Tarboton's Dinf, the terrain around
    each pixel is modelled as eight planar triangular facets, each with a
    continuous aspect angle; but instead of following only the single
    steepest facet, flow is dispersed over ALL downslope facets. Each
    downslope facet receives a share proportional to its slope raised to
    an exponent p (1.1 here, after Freeman), and that facet's share is
    then split between the two grid neighbours bracketing its aspect
    angle, exactly as in Dinf. The result keeps Dinf's sub-grid angular
    precision while representing divergent flow like MFD, without either
    method's blind spot.
      Founder: Seibert, J. and McGlynn, B.L. (2007) 'A new triangular
      multiple flow direction algorithm for computing upslope areas from
      gridded digital elevation models', Water Resources Research, 43(4),
      W04501.
