# dtm to floodplains — Geomorphic floodplains from digital terrain model

The pipeline produces rasters of geomorphic floodplains (GFPLAIN; Nardi et al., 2019) and height
above nearest drain (HAND; Nobre et al., 2016) directly from Finland's
national 2 m elevation model (KM2). This is terrain analysis only, no hydraulic
modelling is done. The pipeline is built for Finnish data provided by the National Land Survey (NLS) and the Environment Institute (SYKE). 

DTM is first carved with SYKE's culvert-correction raster so that flow crosses
road embankments. The carved DTM is then conditioned for hydrological calculations so that every pixel drains out of the DTM. Flow routing and accumulation are calculated on the conditioned DTM and used by the HAND and floodplain calculations. HAND and floodplain heights themselves are calculated on the unconditioned DTM. The pipeline can be modified
to work in other areas by swapping or skipping the culvert-carving stage which at the moment is specific to data available for Finland.
The floodplain delineation (`h = a·A^b`) is the pipeline's only parametrized step. Suitable values of `a` and `b` depend on the intended use.

The six stage scripts are numbered in pipeline order (`01_` … `06_`) and
share one `data/` tree: each stage's output is already the next stage's
default input, and `00_run_pipeline.py` runs them in order. Each stage is
also a standalone command-line script, so any stage can be re-run alone
with different parameters. The three unnumbered files are companion modules
(`pipeline_io.py`, `accumulation.py`, `mdinf.py`) imported by the stages.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antti-a/dtm_to_floodplains.git
cd dtm_to_floodplains
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate water
# drop your DTM tiles (GeoTIFF) into data/00_source_dems/
python 00_run_pipeline.py
```

The result is `data/06_floodplains/floodplains.tif` (1 = floodplain,
0 = upland) plus every intermediate product.

## Running the pipeline

Full run: All six stages:

```bash
python 00_run_pipeline.py
```

Resume after a failure, or run a subset (earlier stages' outputs are
reused):

```bash
python 00_run_pipeline.py --from route
python 00_run_pipeline.py --only condition route
python 00_run_pipeline.py --skip hand
```

Adjust the floodplain parameters: The flood level `h = a·A^b` is the
only parametrized step. `a` sets the overall magnitude of `h`; `b` sets how fast `h` grows as drainage area grows. Suitable values depend on the intended use.


For example:

```bash
python 06_floodplains.py --a 0.2 --b 0.3
```

Denser or sparser stream network for HAND and the floodplains: Lower
or raise the stream-initiation threshold (km² of upstream area):

```bash
python 05_hand.py --upa-min 1.0
python 06_floodplains.py --upa-min 1.0
```

Compare D8, MFD, Dinf and MDinf flow routing algorithms (not needed for
floodplains, but interesting and not widely available elsewhere): Route with all four
algorithms and get each one's stream network (GeoJSON), flow-direction
raster and a comparison table (stream pixels, Jaccard overlaps, drainage
density):

```bash
python 03_flow_router.py --fdir all
```

`python <script> --help` lists everything, including flags that repoint the
input and output locations. Stages 1–2 are configured by the constants at
the top of each script; stages 5–6 also have a `USER SETTINGS` block whose
values are simply the defaults a no-argument run uses.

1. **Carve** — lowers the DTM at culverts and road crossings with the SYKE
"Tierumpujen uomakorjaus" WCS layer so flow crosses embankments.
Downloads are windowed and cached; a re-run skips finished tiles.
2. **Condition** — removes depressions on the mosaic of all tiles and
crops the result back to each tile's grid. `--method breach` (default):
complete breaching (Soille, Vogt and Colombo, 2003; Lindsay, 2016) — a
priority flood from the outlets records how it reached each pixel and,
at every undrainable depression floor, lowers the pixels along that path
to the floor's elevation, cutting a level trench through the barrier;
depression floors keep their elevation and the metres lowered are written
to `data/02_breached/depth/breach_depth.tif`. `--method fill`: pysheds
`fill_depressions` (priority-flood; Barnes et al., 2014), which raises
each depression to its spill level. Both are followed by pysheds
`resolve_flats` (Barnes et al., 2014). Outputs are float64 on purpose:
float32 collapses the flat-resolution gradients and silently
un-conditions the DEM (stage 3 verifies drainage and stops if so).
3. **Route** — mosaics the conditioned tiles and routes flow: D8 by default
(O'Callaghan and Mark, 1984) as that is the format every later stage consumes.
MFD, Dinf and MDinf available via `--fdir` for comparison, each
with its own network, comparison-table row and direction raster.
4. **Accumulate** — weighted flow accumulation (upstream contributing
area) for every flow-direction raster found.
5. **HAND** — height above nearest drain (Nobre et al., 2016): Each pixel's
elevation above the stream pixel it drains to along the D8 flow path,
with streams defined by the `--upa-min` threshold. As in stage 6, the flow
path comes from the stage 3–4 rasters and the elevations from the stage-1
carved DTM.
6. **Floodplains** — GFPLAIN (Nardi et al., 2019): Every stream pixel
carries a flood level `h = a·A^b` (h in m, A = upstream area in km²):
A ground pixel belongs to the floodplain of a stream pixel it drains to if it
rises no more than `h` metres above it. Which stream pixel a pixel drains
to comes from the stage 3–4 rasters (routed on the conditioned DTM); the
elevations of both pixels are read from the stage-1 carved DTM.

## Outputs and metadata

All rasters are GeoTIFFs on the grid and coordinate reference system of the
input DTM tiles; nothing is reprojected. Stage 1 requires EPSG:3067
(ETRS89 / TM35FIN) because the SYKE culvert layer ships in it, so a full
run on Finnish KM2 data produces EPSG:3067 rasters.
If the culvert-carving stage is skipped for other areas, the later stages
accept any single projected, metre-based CRS shared by all tiles.

Every stage stamps its outputs with self-documenting GeoTIFF dataset tags, readable with `gdalinfo <file>` or `rasterio.open(...).tags()`.

## Credits

The beginning of the pipeline follows Rolim da Paz (2025): The condition-route-accumulate
workflow of stages 1–4, and then the pyflwdir library (Eilander et al., 2021;
https://github.com/Deltares/pyflwdir) in stages 5–6 creates HAND after Nobre et al. (2016), and GFPLAIN after
Nardi et al. (2019) with the coefficient `a` made an explicit parameter.

Other essential tools for this project are: pysheds (D8/MFD/Dinf routing; stage 2 depression
filling and flat resolution after Barnes, Lehman and Mulla, 2014; the stage 2 breaching is a
Numba implementation of complete breaching after Soille, Vogt and Colombo, 2003 and Lindsay, 2016),
rasterio/GDAL, NumPy and Numba. The MDinf direction mathematics in
`mdinf.py` follow Seibert and McGlynn (2007), ported via WhiteboxTools'
MIT-licensed implementation (John Lindsay).
